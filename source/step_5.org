- A standard variable is handy for storing a single piece of information.
#+begin_src python   
yourName='Jane'
yourAge=50
likeCrisps=True
#+end_src 

- Sometimes, it's handy to store several pieces of information so that we can access them all when we need them. For this, we use a *list*. 
- Type these commands in the *INTERPRETER* one at a time to get the hang of manipulating lists:
#+begin_src python   
someColours=['Red','Blue','Pink','Black']

print(someColours[0])
someColours.append('Green')

print(someColours)

someColours.sort()
print(someColours)

someColours.reverse()
print(someColours)

someColours.pop()
print(someColours)

someColours.pop(1)
print(someColours)
#+end_src

- Using lists, we can get more flexibility over the patterns we can create. 
#+begin_src python   
import turtle

wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("white") 
wn.title("List Practice")

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.pensize(5)

def colouredSquare(sideLength,newColour):
    tess.color(newColour)
    for x in range(4):
        tess.forward(sideLength)
        tess.left(90)

colourList=['red','green','blue','orange','hotpink','purple']

for eachColour in colourList:
    colouredSquare(75,eachColour)  # Draw a square in the current colour.

    # The len() function will tell you how long a list is, or how many characters are in a string.
    # I'm using it here to calculate the angle I need, based on the size of the list.
    tess.left(360/len(colourList))

wn.mainloop()
#+end_src

- *Silver:* Modify the code to draw the first square with side lengths of 20, the second with size 40, third with 60 and so on. 
- *Gold:* Change the code so that the user can enter five colours that are used to draw a pattern of your choice.
- *Platinum:* Change the code so that the user can enter as many colours as they like, and have a shape drawn with that many sides. E.g.

#+begin_example
Name a Python colour (XYZ when done): red
Name a Python colour (XYZ when done): blue
Name a Python colour (XYZ when done): green
Name a Python colour (XYZ when done): XYZ
Here goes...
#+end_example

- /Tip:/ You'll need to use a [[https://www.bournetocode.com/projects/7-CS-Turing/pages/6_Lesson.html][WHILE]] loop to make this work.
